# Functionality definition
<plan 1>
- User: Use cli to generate endpoint def stubs
- User: Edit endpoint defs accordingly
  -- Docapi: Endpoint to help generate default endpoint defs from the
  bare endpoints list
- User: Use http request to generate manifest by reading the generated endpoint defs
</plan 1>

<plan 2>
- No cli to generate endpoint defs.
- No endpoint defs. Just use only the manifest.
- User: use http request to generate manifest from the bare endpoints. User can edit
manifest.
- Cons: It can get too large or cumbersome to edit. One single file for all endpoints?
- Cons: How to handle grouping.

</plan 2>

<plan 3>
- Http request to read bare endpoints list and generate endpoint def files.
- Each endpoint will have a file.
- Challenge: How to name the files, given only an endpoint path (with slashes in it).
Have to develop a strategy to represent a file name from an endpoint path. Find a character
that will replace the '/'.
</plan 3>
